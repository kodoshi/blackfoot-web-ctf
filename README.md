# Epitech CTF Writeup Project

This is a collection of writeups for various CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges that I have completed during the Web Security module. The challenges are divided into categories, with each category having its own file and screenshots. The purpose of this project is to document my thought process, methodology, and solutions for the challenges, and to serve as a resource for future attempts.
